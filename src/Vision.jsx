  <h1 className="text-blue-800 text-2xl font-bold text-center my-8 ">Vision</h1>

<p className="indent-8">Explain our vision through the following points.</p>

<p>
  1. Our vision is that many players should not play the cricket league being held in their district of the state. Because they are not associated with any registered club or organization (estimates can be 70 to 80% of players, these figures may not be correct for districts in each state, there may be more or less percentage).</p>

<p className="my-2">
2. There can be many reasons for not joining the club.
</p> 
<ul className=" list-disc ml-4 list-outside">
<li > The club admits only those players whose game is already good either.</li>

<li className="my-2"> You must be well trained and have a good understanding of the game before joining the club.
</li>
<li>Sports training is given only in the academy.</li>
</ul>
      
<p className="my-2">
3. But we want that every child should write that he should make his place in the state teams, for that we first select maximum children through trials, so that they can participate in the matches. be prepared for.
</p>

<p>
4. NYCL doesn't just send you home after conducting trials or matches like many private leagues have been doing, but we support you till you play for your state team.
